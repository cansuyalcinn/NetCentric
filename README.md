# A Network-centric Framework for the Evaluation of Mutual Exclusivity Tests on Cancer Drivers

This is the original repository for the Network-centric Framework for the Evaluation of Mutual Exclusivity Tests project codes. The project involves the evaluation of mutual exclusivity methods: Discover, Discover_strat, Fisher's Exact Test, MEGSA, MEMO, and WExT. The results from these methods include pairwise mutual exclusivity p-values. Based on them, we apply our network-centric epistatic evaluation.


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Pyhton: 3.8-3.9

### Getting Started

Using Github clone

## Runs

The codes regarding various analyses given in the main article.

### **ME Evaluations Based on Defined Metrics** 

The main source code for the evaluation ME Tests. As output, you get tables with all analysis results in NetCentric/results_main/evaluation_results
To generate the algorithm for the given input, the following script should be run

```bash
cd src
python evaluations_on_metrics.py
``` 

### **ME Evaluations Based on Corrections via MLA**

Scatterplots of percentage significance of mutual exclusivity runs vs mutation load association (MLA)
As output, you get results in NetCentric/results_main/evaluation_results/percent_sig_figures

```bash
cd src
python evaluations_via_mla.py
```

Scatterplots of percentage significance of mutual exclusivity runs vs mutation load association (MLA) when only CGC genes that have > 1 neighbors are included.
As output, you get results in NetCentric/results_main/evaluation_results/percent_sig_figures/perc_sig_figures_for_multiple_neighbors

```bash
cd src
python evaluations_via_mla_neighbors.py
```

### **ME Evaluations Based on Corrections via TSN**

Network-centric epistasis evaluation framework run on the tissue-specific network (TSN). As output, you get results in NetCentric/results_main/evaluation_results/intact

```bash
cd src
python evaluations_via_tsn.py
```

ROC curves for comparing the mutual exclusivities of tissue-specific and non-tissue specific CGC-CGC gene pairs and non-CGC-non-CGC gene pairs on.
As output, you get results in NetCentric/results_main/figure_tsn_AUROC

```bash
cd src
python me_on_tsn_ntsn_roc_curve.py

```
