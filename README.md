# A Network-centric Framework for the Evaluation of Mutual Exclusivity Tests on Cancer Drivers

This is the original repository for the Network-centric Framework for the Evaluation of Mutual Exclusivity Tests project codes. The project involves the evaluation of mutual exclusivity methods: Discover, Discover_strat, Fisher's Exact Test, MEGSA, MEMO, and WExT. The results from these methods include pairwise mutual exclusivity p-values. Based on them, we apply our network-centric epistatic evaluation.


## Installation

Installing the dependencies

```bash
conda install --file requirements.txt
```
Installing the conda env

```bash
conda env create -f netcent2.yml
``` 

## Input

#### data
1. The PPI network edge and index files. The files are located in data/intact_nodupl_edge_file.txt and data/intact_nodupl_index_file.txt 

```bash
